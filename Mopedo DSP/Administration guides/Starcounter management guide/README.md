# Starcounter management guide

The Mopedo DSP application runs inside a Starcounter in-memory database. This means that all the information that is used by the Mopedo DSP is stored on the server that runs the application. On the [Starcounter developer site](https://docs.starcounter.io/guides/working-with-starcounter), there are some useful guides for how to set up things like [backups](https://docs.starcounter.io/guides/working-with-starcounter/run-starcounter-in-production#backup-and-failover), [data exports and imports](https://docs.starcounter.io/guides/working-with-starcounter/stardump-cli), [crash dumps](https://docs.starcounter.io/guides/working-with-starcounter/investigating-app-crashes) and more.
