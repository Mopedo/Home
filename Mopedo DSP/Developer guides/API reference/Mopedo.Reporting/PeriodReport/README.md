# `PeriodReport`

```json
{
    "Name": "Mopedo.Reporting.PeriodReport",
    "Kind": "EntityResource",
    "Methods": ["GET", "REPORT", "HEAD"]
}
```

`PeriodReport` is a [short-term reporting resource](../Reporting%20overview#short-term-reports) that enables flexible aggregated spending reports, grouped by some given time period. Say, for example, that we want to get the daily spending for some campaign's spending during the last 60 days. This could be done with 60 separate requests to the `DailySpendingReport` resource â€“ but with the `PeriodReport` resource we can do it with just one. The following properties can be used to specify the report parameters:
