# Built-in resources overview

RESTar has a number of built-in web resources that provide useful utilities and API metadata for consumers and administrators. The resources are ordered into three namespaces:

- **RESTar**

> Utilities for consumers and administrators

- **RESTar.Admin**

> Utilities for administrators

- **RESTar.Dynamic**

> Dynamic resources created at runtime

It is recommended that the `RESTar.Admin` namespace is [restricted to only administrators](../Administering%20a%20RESTar%20API/API%20keys). Use the sidebar menu to explore the namespaces.
