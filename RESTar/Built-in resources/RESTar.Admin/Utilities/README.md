# `Utilities`

```json
{
    "Name": "RESTar.Admin.Utilities",
    "Kind": "TerminalResource",
    "Methods": ["GET"]
}
```

The `Utilities` is a terminal resource that can trigger operations useful for administrators. Currently, the only available option in the resource is `ReloadConfigFile`, which reloads the [configuration file](../../../Administering%20a%20RESTar%20API/Configuration) and loads [API keys](../../../Administering%20a%20RESTar%20API/API%20keys) and allowed [CORS origins](../../../Administering%20a%20RESTar%20API/CORS).
