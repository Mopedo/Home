# Administering a RESTar API

Apart from the usual tasks associated with running a web service, the task of administering a RESTar API can be defined as:

1. Setting up a [configuration file](../Configuration) that specifies [API keys](../ApiKeys) and allowed [CORS origins](../CORS), making sure that consumers have the right set of access privileges.
2. [Securing the REST API with HTTPS](../HTTPS) by, for example, setting up SSL encryption and firewall rules.
3. [Setting up macros](../Macros) that simplify complex requests.
4. [Setting up JSON output formats](../JSON%20output%20formats) to conform to external standards.
5. [Setting up webhooks](../Webhooks) that are triggered by events raised by the RESTar application.
6. Other tasks such as setting database indexes, assigning aliases to resources, creating dynamic resources and troubleshooting resource errors. Check out the built-in resources in the [RESTar.Admin](../../Built-in%20resources/RESTar.Admin) namespace for some useful tools and utilities.
